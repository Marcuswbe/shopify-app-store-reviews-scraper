1431992,Loshen & Crem,"I regret having to leave a negative review for Shopify POS. Our experience has been terrible. We needed a system to consolidate our inventory in one place, and despite the bad reviews, we decided to give it a try anyway. Unfortunately, the negative reviews were right. It's disappointing to see a big company like Shopify unable to fix their POS issues. We've lost numerous sales because their hardware wasn't working properly. Now, the system is completely dead, and according to their support, we have to wait 48 hours for a resolution. TERRIBLE.",1,"June 10, 2024",Canada,Almost 5 years using the app
1452904,The Bark Side,"I'm looking for a new POS system. The checkout just hangs, sometimes as you're trying to add a product to cart, other times before loading the payment screen, and at other times when completing the payment. It's awful, even more so since the most recent update. It's also cumbersome to add products to the cart in the first place.  POS needs to be quick, and at the moment I'm losing customers because of this awful app.  I'm heading into my busy part of the year and I simply cannot rely on this app. If Shopify want to see what a good POS app looks like, then see how Zettle's works - it's head and shoulders above this one.  I wanted to be able to run my ecommerce store and POS via the same company, but now it's looking like I'll need to revert to Zettle for POS and keep the store with Shopify. That's more work for me, in terms of adding and syncing inventory, but this app is barely usable. Another minor issue is that, as the checkout is loading, the margin (in actual GBP) pops up quickly.  How would a customer feel if they saw that?  My life flashes befoe my eyes each time as I try to shield the tablet from them.   Seriously, Shopify - do better.  in the meantime, I'll decide whether to revert to Zettle or find another provder. Awful, awful, AWFUL app.",1,"July 1, 2024",United Kingdom,10 months using the app
1394646,Pet Grocer Inc.,"Shopify sells you this app with certain features, then at a whim, and with no notice to the users, takes away those features and functions. It is routinely changed (with no notice) so that you end up with multiple errors at the check out and constantly have to re-train staff, and re-work all your processes.  As an example, the save cart feature (which they still advertise as available) is gone. The 'improvement' is clunky, hard to use, and full of bugs. They removed the one button to search for a client in your system to assign to a sale. They introduced a bug where the cursor jumps in the middle of you typing. They changed the only good thing they had (their search engine) so now it tries to auto correct your spelling, for names!  This is just the most recent in a long line of frustrating choices by the devs at Shopify. Their careers page actually shows you they *encourage* their staff to change fast and create chaos. It's literally their value set and culture - to make sure that there is no stable system for users. We actively search for other pos systems routinely, and will continue to search until we find something that is better or Shopify finally listens to its user base and corrects this poorly designed system. We feel trapped and lied to. Go read the user forums before you decide to use this system.",1,"May 3, 2024",Canada,About 3 years using the app

We migrated from a rival POS system expecting Shopify to outshine them on all fronts. It has been precisely the opposite. The UI is slick, but the features are barebones. Digital receipts don't scan. Can't run reports on inventory adjustments. Reporting altogether is very minimal. Can't reload gift cards. Label printing is worthless. I've been working the forums like crazy trying to find workarounds for this and workarounds for that. We've had to add more than a dozen apps on top of Shopify just to get close to the functionality that we had in our old POS system. Here's the kicker - Shopify + all of the apps that we've piled on is now almost $3,000/month. We were paying $350/month with our old system for better brick and mortar functionality. We were sold on Shopify Plus as the future - and for Ecom - it probably is. But if you have a brick and mortar store - they're not close yet. Tech support has been kind and helpful, but their hands are tied by a platform that is simply lacking basic functionality for a growing physical store.

In the beginning, they had a free version, but it did not print receipts or have a ""Save Cart"" feature. So I opted for the paid version of POS. It wasn't much more at the time, but then Shopify combined the paid version as part of the ecommerce site for no extra fee, Yay! (Except Hey, I have been paying for it for a while and now it's free? hmmm)  So then they raised the price of the ecommerce, which still included the previous paid POS version. Fine. I was okay with the arrangement.  Most of my sales are online, but once a week we are open, like a pop-up. I love the POS system on the ipad, that uses a barcode scanner, printer, and card reader.

Except now they have a Pro Version - For $89 a month extra!  As soon as they came out with it, they took away the ""Save Cart"" feature in the ""lite"" version, (which was what the version I had was now called). I cannot justify spending $89 more a month for 4 days of sales just so I can save carts while my customers shop. My work around is to have a second ipad so I can at least have 2 carts going at a time.

 It is unpractical that only certain hardware is available for use with the app, and that this hardware is unexistent outside certain countries or extremely expensive. 
 It makes no sense that my current computers cant be used, and im forced to use tablets of mobile devices. This issue, next to the associated hardware makes scaling extremely expensive, and opening new venues implies purchasing the expensive and selective associated hardware. 
 Finally subscription costs are expensive, charging 80USd for being able to associate sales with employees. This should be a basic feature of the app, included with the plus 1000USD i pay monthly for shopify",1,"October 6, 2023",Colombia,11 months using the app
1228522,Evergreen Curated,"Free app is great for merchants just starting out, you get what you need to start selling at in person events. I gave 2 stars because merchants should beware of using tap to pay on iphone. As seen on Shopify forums, many merchants have issues with tap to pay on iphone connectivity - it rarely works (it has only worked once or twice for me) forcing me to enter card payments manually. This was fine until I realized from another forum poster that Shopify payments charges higher fees for manual card entry even though it is a Shopify app issue that tap to pay is not working. So be sure to get a card reader so you can avoid this!",2,"November 13, 2023",United States,11 months using the app
1213670,Conrad's Best Gourmet Gifts,This is by far the most anoquated and difficult system. Furthermore Shopify should catch up with the times as people have been requesting desktop and pc option since 2016 and earlier. They force you to buy their equipment and it is a joke at best. The industry has moved on from this crappy equipment and so should shopify. Many of shopifys own aps do not work with POS and processes are aweful.

For example, the product fields have weight, but not dimensions. So they claim that we can connect our UPS discounts but that's not true since you need package dims, eh? Also, the COGS of any given product DOES NOT update when receiving new inventory at a higher/lower cost. One simply re-calculates the new weighted COGS for each product shipment in excel and types that in, ugh. Also their PLUS, at $2000/month, does not allow the POS to talk to the eCommerce.

One year in, and I STILL HATE this POS. Clunky and hard to navigate through those stupid tiles, and no updates to the design at all. UPDATE: This is still a horribly designed POS system. The user experience clearly was not tested in the real world. And now they have changed the inventory management to be even worse. Of course you can always pay them more money to get some of those old very basic features back. SCAM This app used to be great. The new update is TERRIBLE!!! The ""lite"" version is missing basic every day functions- cant do exchanges anymore, employees cant log in, and they lay out is just bad and confusing.

732032,Lockdown Security,"WARNING FOR THOSE WHO ACCEPT INTERAC DEBIT! Shopify has now disabled support for the Moneris External PIN PAD, meaning those Canadian clients who accept INTERAC DEBIT can no longer provide PIN pad access (for entering PIN #s to their clients). PIN#s now have to be entered using the iPad or iPhone device, which in the time of COVID is a health risk, especially if the iPad is behind your counter (bye bye social distance). The only way an INTERAC user can complete their transaction is through the new CHIP and PIN reader, via TAP, but TAP transactions have $100 limits, meaning if you sell anything over $100 (like we do ALL the time), the client cannot pay for it with INTERAC. It is insane that a Canadian founded and Canadian based company, cannot integrate properly with a very popular Canadian payment method??? Added to this, Shopify has taken what used to be an included free feature (POS functionality), and made it an $80 USD paid feature per month, this is insane! And as you can see by all the 1 star reviews, that $80 USD per month is buying you a worse experience!

34841,Mr Simms Hk Limited,"==Update== Please avoid Shopify for their POS at all costs.  The app has not been working for a significant percentage of customers for 10 days (according to Shopify themselves), and will take at least another 5 business days to fix.  Today is 24 December.  Christmas is tomorrow.  It is haemorrhaging our business. === We have learnt to work around Shopify's many limitations and constraints.  Please see our review for Mr Simms Wanchai and Emack & Bolio's below. If you read the older reviews, many features have been suggested for years now, and so I don't think Shopify are treating their POS platform as a priority for development. What is unacceptable is for the POS to breakdown the week before Christmas, when our sales are at their peak.  Our customers get frustrated, and it is losing us sales every minute the system is down.  When we launch the app, it crashes, so we cannot upload the crash report.  I have been told not to delete the app and reinstall, so we are still waiting for a fix. Meanwhile we are losing sales.  Thanks Shopify. We have 2 POS terminals in the shop, and both are not reliable.  The app frequently (once an hour) crashes, meaning we have to rescan all the customer's items when there is a queue to checkout.  Shopify POS is not for heavy usage. Shopify technical support have informed me that the POS is not working for a small number of customers, but won't give any timeframe for the situation to be fixed. What is really frustrating is the number of gurus you get passed to, so you end up repeating yourself 10+ times literally.  To be fair, the gurus are friendly and try to help, but don't deliver on their promises and don't update you without you chasing up. I don't want to get started about the integration issues we have had with other inventory management systems and Xero.  Shopify does not calculate COGS.

34840,Mr Simms Wanchai,"When Shopify POS works, it is a mediocre POS at best.  The problem is it is unreliable, and will crash usually when your shop gets busy leaving customers frustrated. As many other reviewers have said, it lacks many basic retailing features. For example, when we opened a second shop, we had to open a new account and import all the products in again.  Do Shopify expect their users to not grow their businesses?  That's why we have two separate Shopify accounts, so when we issue a gift voucher in one shop say, our customers cannot redeem at the other shop.  Neither can they do exchanges.  The list goes on. However our issue for this shop account is with data integrity.  We have experienced situations where receipts are printed with sales that do not add up to the total.  This creates a lot of daily reconciling work for us, and confusion for customers. We have sent photos to Shopify showing negative amounts on receipts (e.g. according to Shopify we are giving money and product away!).  Support are friendly to be fair, and well trained to sound helpful, but as yet we have no solution. Like the reviewer below, when you cannot trust the data, you may as well go back to pen and paper.

The collections are showing items that are listed or unchecked as POS! Who designed this software? What questions got asked? This has to be the most wasted use of development ever!

The new version promises a lot of things that are of no real benefit to physical retail, doesn't address any of the missing functionality, is VERY VERY glitchy, and is now going to cost more. Simple tasks such as scanning products into the sale are now operations that take 3,4 or 5 different procedures!! The main reason for continuing with it is the syncing of inventory between multiple sales channels and 1 set of stock, but have even had a glitch with the POS finding a product that was in the system!

817630,The Annapolis Pottery,"I really wish this could be a 5-star review. After decades with our prior in-store POS, we made the switch to Shopify POS so our online store and our in-store systems were on the same platform. While Shopify works great online, Shopify POS is nowhere near ready for prime time for a business like ours (small retailer, thousands of SKUs, many product variants, owners who are analytical about inventory). Issues include but are not limited to -
 - POS Bluetooth hardware that constantly disconnects - Practically unusable barcode apps. Needed two apps: one for printing from purchase orders and one to print individual labels when needed. The labels look different and the apps were exceedingly difficult to set up and use. - the inventory app, Stocky, only holds inventory data for 90 days. This means you must perpetually pull data into Excel via this app called Matrixify and then run all your analytics for YOY purchase decisions in Excel. What a pain. - Shopify POS support is absolutely inadequate. Extremely hard to get a tech on the phone, and their responses are often emails that just include links to pages in Shopify Help. They cannot log onto your POS and assist with troubleshooting or quickly resolve issues in an emergency. I could go on, but I think you get the point. We entered into working with Shopify POS with our eyes open and a lot of consideration. Ultimately, we invested several thousand dollars in hardware and hundreds of person-hours in data preparation to make this change. In the end, we pulled the plug and returned to our prior POS provider. We simply could not put our business at risk during the holiday season with Shopify POS. It's just not an integrated platform and it's not well supported.",1,"November 23, 2021",United States,Almost 3 years using the app

353746,Gym Culture,"Absolutely terrible, and missing so many basic features that should be included in any POS system. Admin access is required to login to the store, ok not a problem.  Except that the app automatically logs out several times a week and requires the admin credentials and password to get back in.  There are staff PINs, but they only work once you are logged into the store with an admin account. 
  There is no way for a POS or limited access account to login.  I am rarely at the store, so I have to give all my employees all my login info so they can use the POS app.  That's insane!  All of my minimum wage, part time employees have full, unrestricted, admin access to all areas of the POS app and online store. When it does logout, it also loses a lot of information when you log back in.  The integrated Moneris terminal for one.  Under payment methods, the toggle is turned off by default, and when you turn it on, none of the config setting are saved.  You have to get the IP address of the terminal again, input the ECR ID as well as the merchant ID, and reinitialize.  This happens every time!  I have lost hundreds of dollars in sales from customers coming to the checkout to pay, only to have the terminal not work, and my employees not able to get it running before they get tired of waiting.  My employees have called me while I'm at my other business (a restaurant) so I can try and trouble shoot it for them over the phone.  During which, I'm losing customers there too!  Losing customers at two businesses at the same time because Shopify keeps logging out and losing important information like terminal settings. Aside from constantly losing me money, it is also useless when trying to remotely manage a business.  If you have multiple locations, don't even bother.  It doesn't track employee hours, you can't see when employees are clocking in or out, you can't see how much money should be in the till at any given time, how much cash is being deposited etc.  You can only check these from the actual physical iPad at that location.  Why can you not check these from the admin console instead of me having to physically go to all my store locations to check each individual iPad?

Asking web site adress and password so often, and you need store owner phone number to received one-time password which is not gonna be able to log in without that password. If the owner of store is away, you cant even activate POS. 3. Hard to get support, that is one of reason I needed to leave bad feed back here with little hope to be fixed.

We need a way to give customers credit in their account.  This will also help us tie in our online store with the POS by allowing customers to redeem their credit either via the website or in store using the POS system.
 2. No way to exchange products
    Update:  Shoppify POS support told us that exchanged can be made, however, it really isn't an exchange at all.  We will have to manually refund the items for exchange to a store credit, complete the order, THEN repurchase the new items with the store credit.  So really, Shopify POS still does not support exchanges.  I have not been able to verify this as our trial ran out.  
 3. No way to assign product cost to each product, thus making it impossible to keep track of inventory cost.
    Update: Support staff informed us that the app DeepMine has the ability to assign cost to each product and variation.  Although this is A solution, this basic feature really should be built right into the the product information as an extra attribute in the first place.  We have paid for DeepMine in order to assign costs to our products, however, it is still in beta state, and the interface is a huge pain in the ass to use.
 4. Unable to assign customers to customer groups for predefined discount rates.
 5. No visible notes field for each customer that is visible before clicking in to the customer's profile.  This needs to be visible on the same screen when displaying a search result of customers.
 6. Super clumsy interface.  Image size needs to be customizable to allow for much smaller image.  Also, the POS system needs to provide a No Image option, that displays a top down alphabetical list.

It's easy to use as a register in most ways as well when it comes to just finding products and ringing them up etc. We love that our inventory for online and in store is all one place. The templates are great and our website looks professional. The only things that detract from this being five stars is that it lacks a few features. Like when counting out your register there is no denominations so you have to write down all your denominations and add it up with a calculator before  closing your register and entering how much is in the till. Nor is there a receipt printed for your own records you have to print an additional if you want that done. Also when entering new products it only allows you to enter how much you are selling it for not it's cost when you bought it, being able to use a mark up percentage would be a great addition. While Shopify links and exports to Quickbooks it doesn't have a cost of goods when going through accounting and profit and loss it's difficult to determine. You have to download another app to do cost of goods. Which we keep finding, everytime we are looking for a feature that has almost always been available for old school POS systems it requires downloading another app which costs more money.

First of all, in order to have our store's logo on the receipt, we need to subscribe to a plan of $79 USD per month. Given that at this time, we only need this particular feature, there is no way that we can justify paying this much just to have our logo on it. And second, the Shopify order number does not print on the invoice. The reason why this is frustrating to me is because it can cause confusion when doing financial reports. It is a very simple option that would save us time and confusion. I explained to my team that receipt numbers always match order numbers, but it's just strange to have two different identifiers for the same order. Other than that, an absolute breeze to use.

We are in our busiest time of year (when we also have temporary employees working) and we have spent hours trying to figure out our own way of getting around the issues as our phone calls to customer service have revealed that it will probably be a while before most of the issues are fixed. It is EMBARRASSING in front of customers when we cannot even issue a return or it credits them back inadvertantly and we have to ask them to pay again. Not to mention that when you print a ""gift receipt""- a whole list of everything the person purchased prints onto the receipt. Who wants someone to know what all they purchased or if they are giving 15 people the same gift. How special does that feel? Very BASIC procedures are no longer possible. You cannot start a return unless you find the original order in the system- which doesn't work when someone is bringing back a gift. This new PRO POS is eating away at our productivity. We have had more calls into the support line in the last 2 weeks than the whole time we have used shopify. The home screen is nothing like the previous version where you could ""see"" your store and you basically do not have a menu driven system.

20623,Spoil Me Kidz Boutique,"The benefit to the Shopify POS is that it integrates your online store with your brick and mortar store and syncs the inventory. This saves a lot of labor time. It is also easy to use and doesn't require much training.  The Cons... It only works with certain overpriced equipment.  There is no option to exchange an item, which is a pretty standard thing amongst POS systems. You must refund as store credit and then use store credit to purchase the new item. The system does not keep track of the store credit. You only have a receipt to go by. There is nothing to stop the customer from trying to use that store credit again.  You need to use Shopify as the payment gateway otherwise you cannot use their card swiper and will need to process credit cards with a different system (Shopify tech support tells you that you can use any gateway without mentioning the fine print).  It allows employees to discount items up to %100 off without the need of a managers approval. However, it does not allow you to change the price of an item when checking out a customer... only lets you discount. This issue came up when there was a mistake with the price of an item and my employee had no way of correcting it at time of checkout.  The system constantly loses contact with the wireless barcode scanner, card swiper, and receipt printer. You have to restart the POS app to reconnect them while the customers are standing and waiting.   Overall, it is a good system to help keep track of all of your stores and sales. If inventory syncing is not that important for you, there really is no reason to overpay for the Shopify POS.",2,"January 2, 2015",United States,Over 1 year using the app

Now the lite feature is useless as I can't create just POS accounts without paying for their service. Don't need to fulfill or create orders or anything special, just checkout customers and have inventory and revenue show up in our Shopify system.

In this upgrade version each time you open a collection and add an item, you get taken back to the main screen, so you have to keep opening and adding it.

642790,Good Cheese,"I'm disappointed we're having to switch over to a paid POS system just to retain the existing functionality offered with the previous App. It wouldn't be so bad if we were getting more value out of it but, none of the features they've introduced are particularly useful in a retail setting. I would happily trade in the ability to customize my home screen for the ability to process refunds in a practical manner. I hesitate to say but, it even appears that we will be losing value from the time it's going to take to parse out all of the nuanced differences and retrain my staff. Navigation in general is not intuitive for users of the previous app. The verbiage has for the most part completely changed and is not in-line with the standards set by other POS systems. The cashout is confusing. All in all, it seems like a product designed by software engineers for software engineers and not retail salespeople. If you are in a situation where you do not need to rely on the Shopify POS for inventory management I would not recommend it. As of 10/17/2020 - Back with more observations... The product search is indexed is completely differently from the previous POS and the shopify online store App. For example: Searching for a popular product we sell called ""Delice"" now pulls up search results for every single item on our online store with the word ""delicate"" in the description. For most use cases this sort of thing is probably pretty edge but we have hundreds of SKUs and delicate is a pretty common adjective in the wine/fine food industry. There is also a relatively significant delay in applying tax to the total cost of sales which is leading to a lot of cash out errors during peak periods. Also note none of your configuration from the previous version of the app (such as payment method settings) will carry over. Between the new monthly cost and the time I'm spending retraining/figuring out how to make this version of the POS function at the same level of efficiency as the previous one I'm definitely losing money.

8626,Helios Junks,"*This app had an update which fixed several of my major issues with it, so I've revived this review* This is a solid and much needed addition to the Shopify platform. Its very usable, it requires almost no training to figure it out, is easily integrated into the store. I think the layout could have a few tweaks to make it more seamless (refreshing the selected collection when you start a new order and perhaps making it easier to select collections for example) but overall its pretty fast to use, and wont cause much of a headache. There are a few reasons why I haven't given this a higher rating, firstly is that its expensive. We already pay a premium price for backend hosting of our store, really this is a $49 a month fee simply to process offline transactions. Really its a premium price for a basic product. The app has some limitations, reports on the app are non existent, other than a sales tally. That means you have no way of knowing how many of a particular product has been sold, how much you've made each hour, how much from different collections you've sold. Theres a lot of useful information that you should have access to on the fly, but you don't unless you use the computer interface.  The use of printers/ scanners and till drawers is limited to only very specific models. This no doubt makes the installation of the physical POS assets easy and very reliable, however unless you live in North America the receipt printers and till drawers aren't really readily available, so you have to buy a more expensive version off eBay, which is disappointing. Even the inclusion of AirPrint would be very welcome. The ability to see product descriptions in the app would also be useful, often if you sell a large amount of products, someone might have a questions which you cant readily answer, but having that information available to you would be very useful. Ultimately its very useful. It is a real timesaver when it comes to updating quantities manually which is really its most redeeming feature. I don't think its quite equal to the $600 a year price you have to pay, its not really a complete system yet, but I suspect it might be after a few big updates.",3,"November 27, 2013",Australia,11 months using the app

The cart is not accessible from every screen which makes adding and removing items more difficult and require more steps than necessary. When you add an item to the cart, you can only add one item. If you need to change the quantity of any item you have to go back to the menu, go back to the cart then change the quantity. You should just be able to change the quantity before you add the item to the cart. The ""Ship to customer"" option is only available at the beginning of the sale which is incredibly inconvenient. When my customer decides half way through the sale they'd rather ship instead of carry the items with them. If anything the ""Ship to customer"" option should be a separate page or section before you check out the customer with a simple toggle switch that enables shipping or pick up.

In order to get the readers to reconnect I had to either make the my phone or iPad to forget the device or completely restart my phone or iPad.

 The only issue with the app is sometimes if we add new products to Shopify it does not sync properly and some products do not show up on the point of sale or some variants don't come up such as certain sizes could be missing, even though they are perfect and correct in Shopify and on our website. The only solution we found to this issue was to delete and uninstall the app and reinstall it and it seemed to have fixed it.
 Overall I would recommend the point of sale app, it takes a bit of time to get used to as it is quite different from a regular till and might take a bit of technology knowledge to get used to it, but once you get used to it and give it some time it is very handy to use and handy to keep track of everything happening in your shop. You can also see the orders that have been made online and in store and can filter through them which is another great feature.",4,"December 16, 2020",Ireland,3 months using the app
521249,Waller BMX,"Terrible app. The worst for us being that you cannot increase prices when selling in store and therefore have to give away money. Online prices are usually less due to the overheads. In store we need to charge more and the app doesn't allow you to increase the price thus we lose money on each instore sale.

672352,sbnature Store,"***Helpful to a point. But will take YOUR tech-savviness to be successful***
 The App is helpful as it means I only have 1 inventory between my online and in-store shoppers. I also like how mobile it is, and how quick it is to checkout. My 2-star deduction is because sometimes it takes a minute or two for things to sync between the Shopify admin and POS. Something might scan and be found through search in the admin interface but when attempting to scan or search through the POS, it won't find it. This has forced us to use the Custom Sale option but means we have to backtrack and fix quantities later-- so it's like i have two inventories again. The support is fine- they are always available but sometimes we get lost in translation and they often have scripted responses that are frustrating, as it feels they're not really hearing me and my needs, but trying to get 5 Star survey results. I was sifted through several ""launch specialists"" when I was converting systems and it was tough to feel helped as I had to reexplain and reintroduce my progress to several people. Eventually, I just stopped asking as they seemed too busy or uninvested. I would call instead of email as email tickets can take several days or they don't answer at all. Other updates I'd like to see: Making a specific collection ""non-discountable"" as we offer a ""member"" discount for people every day, but some items' profit margins are too narrow to apply an additional discount. So my staff needs to outsmart the system. Secondly, a connection to Blackbaud would be awesome as I could load or view my members through there. Finally, as a non-profit Museum, this has been an inexpensive way to stay in modern times but our store has a lot of products (5000+) available that it seems Shopify struggles to update or keep track of seamlessly.",3,"December 13, 2020",United States,6 months using the app

663923,Venus Envy,"We switched to Shopify POS so that we could have more cohesive inventory and data management between our online store and brick and mortar. It's okay, but lacking in some significant areas. Pros: -Fairly intuitive to use/teach staff
 -Easy search
 -Stocky is overall a good inventory management system, despite a few small complaints Cons:
 -No function to honour Status Cards/Tax Exemptions in Canada (which I believe may be illegal in Ontario)
 -Unable to edit any product details/add bar codes/adjust stock/change price etc. inside the POS app, which makes a lot more work for managers and creates many issues/errors
 -I was told I would have dedicated ""set-up support"" but it seems that that person's job was just to email me links and direct me to the general help line
 -Support staff are unevenly trained - a few times I've called with a specific question and received multiple different answers from different people
 -No ""Void"" function and returns/exchanges are unnecessarily complicated Overall, it doesn't feel like there were many people consulted who actually work in retail. It would be a lot more convenient to stay with Shopify, so I hope it improves.",2,"November 26, 2020",Canada,3 months using the app

We are functioning, but I would not use this POS if it were not for the website and gift registry ap we use.  Staff permissions still needs a significant overhaul.  I am happy to say that the receipts have improved.  Still no customization option for me as the user, but the developers have removed the ""double name"" issue.  Our largest issue after two months of use though is the return/exchange issue.  We still have a separate ""old"" register to process returns as shopify does not offer a ""real world"" brick and motar solution for returns/exchanges.  The ap needs a manager override return options that allows a ""custom return.""  Inventory can be adjusted after the fact, but it is just not realistic to hunt for a previous order or an order that was processed prior to using shopify.  The return option offered may work for brand new businesses who are starting fresh with e-commerce, but it is not functional for established brick and motar expanding to ecommerce.  Looking forward to a solution on this major oversight. June 2020: The POS app has A LOT of room for development such as staff permissions.  I should be able to limit who can process a return/refund/exchange or limit the type of discount a staff member can provide.  But the top of the list is the physical receipts.
